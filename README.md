<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What is N_Squared? 
N_Squared is a Winforms application written using C# that visually represents various sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, etc.). It was originally developed as a learning tool to develop a better understanding of SYDE 223 course concepts. The image below is a preview of the application:
